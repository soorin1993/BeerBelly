The equinox, and the intrigue of equal night and day, has deep roots in history and ritual. But, at the same time, the equinox marks the changing of the season, and forces us to look toward the future. We find it interesting that the two days out of the year that have perfect light and dark balance also show the balance between the past and the future, tradition and innovation. Beer contains similar elements. Sure, there\u2019s the balance of flavors in a beer; sweet and bitter, rich and simple\u2026\r\n\r\nWe find another aspect of beer\u2019s balancing act fascinating. Historically, beer styles have developed because of limitations in local ingredients and the necessity to make do with what you have. However, due to global trade and modern shipping methods, limitations on ingredients have been removed. We can get any ingredients we want. While most modern brewers recognize the importance of beer styles and learn from the brewers who made them, they certainly don\u2019t limit themselves to making beers that fit into traditional definitions.\r\n\r\nOn one level our beers fit into some traditional styles, but we put our own twist on them. We want our beers to capture elements from the past and incorporate new ideas, ingredients and techniques into them. We\u2019re not afraid to try new things.\r\n\r\nAs a brewer, its playtime and work, balanced.","website":"http:\/\/www.equinoxbrewing.com\/","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/wYyIFx\/upload_iB5vAJ-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:54","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:07:44"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"Q4eTmd","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"800 East Lincoln Avenue","locality":"Fort Collins","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80524","phone":"1-970-498-9070","website":"http:\/\/odellbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tap Room: \r\nMonday - Thursday 11am - 6pm \r\nFriday - Saturday: 11am - 7pm\r\n\r\nBrewery Tours:\r\nMonday - Saturday: 1:00, 2:00, & 3:00pm","latitude":40.5894674,"longitude":-105.0631819,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1989","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:04","updateDate":"2016-01-20 17:48:13","breweryId":"rQkKIB","brewery":{"id":"rQkKIB","name":"Odell Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Odell","description":"We love beer.

Brad Lincoln first experienced craft beer while working as an accountant in Portland, OR. The two met during the winter of 2009 while attending the Siebel Institute and studying brewing science. After being immersed in beer for the better part of five months, the two graduated and shared a desire to open a brewery. This resulted in the Saison-focused brewery that is now Funkwerks, opening December 9, 2010.\r\n \r\nSaisons originated as Belgian farmhouse ales- brewed during winter months for the farm workers during the summer months. Usually having a dry profile and complex fruity aromas, Saisons today are brewed year-round and generally have a higher alcohol percentage than their original versions.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks\u2019 two flagship beers, Saison and Tropic King, are produced year round. Also brewed annually are four seasonals, a number of small experimental batches, and select barrel-aged releases. Funkwerks flagship Saison was awarded a gold medal at the 2012 Great American Beer Festival (GABF) and a silver medal in 2011. Deceit, a Belgian-Style golden strong ale, was also awarded a gold medal at the GABF in 2012. In addition to receiving two gold medals in 2012, the GABF named Funkwerks the 2012 Small Brewing Company of the Year.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is located at 1900 East Lincoln Avenue in Fort Collins, Colorado. The tasting room- complete with an indoor bar, retail area and spacious outdoor, dog-friendly patio- is open 7 days a week: Sunday through Thursday from 12pm-8pm; Friday and Saturday from 12pm-9pm. Brewery tours are given Saturdays at 2pm.\r\n \r\nFunkwerks is currently distributed in:\r\nColorado:\r\nC.R.

For Jeff Lebesch would return to Fort Collins with a handful of ingredients and an imagination full of recipes. And then there was beer. Jeff's first two basement-brewed creations? A brown dubbel with earthy undertones named Abbey and a remarkably well-balanced amber he named Fat Tire. To say the rest was history would be to overlook his wife's involvement.
