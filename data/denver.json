The Slo-Hi location was developed to allow a local clientele, as well as beer aficionados and lovers of good times a central spot in Denver to enjoy a proper pint and have a chat. We will always have three to four great beers on tap via CO2 pressurized kegs and plan to maintain properly conditioned Real Ale from naturally carbonated casks served from beer engines for those that enjoy this traditional British libation. The brewing system and associated cellar has been custom designed with an integrated control system, that allow the brewer to process from one to ten barrels in a batch process and ferment in temperature controlled Stainless Steel vessels. Each of the beers have been formulated from carefully selected malted barley, treated water, multiple varieties of hops, and a specific yeast strain to produce the flavor, mouth-feel, alcohol content, aroma and bitterness, as well as the complex flavor profile according to the time and temperature recipe intended by the brewer. In addition to the attention to detail required for consistent and repeatable brews the brewmaster and support personnel follow a disciplined regiment of cleaning manually, and automatically with Clean-In-Place Systems (CIP) to exclude off-flavors, contaminants, and other undesirables in our beers. Every beer we serve has been naturally processed without the assistance of filtration which is why we are intensely focused on the highest quality ingredients, temperature controls, and finish aging to serve a quality product that we hope you enjoy as much as we do.","website":"http:\/\/www.hogsheadbrewery.com\/","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/otXCdW\/upload_pJQGom-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-10-16 14:20:59","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:00:18"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"dACAeT","name":"Lowdown Brewery + Kitchen","streetAddress":"800 Lincoln Street","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80203","phone":"(720) 524-8065","website":"http:\/\/www.lowdownbrewery.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nTue:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nWed:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nThu:  11:00am - 11:00pm\nFri:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSat:  11:00am - 12:00am\nSun:  11:00am - 11:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.729689,"longitude":-104.98576,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2014","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-06 12:10:22","updateDate":"2016-04-10 22:16:54","breweryId":"dM7gjl","brewery":{"id":"dM7gjl","name":"Lowdown Brewery + Kitchen","nameShortDisplay":"Lowdown Brewery + Kitchen","description":"LowDown is the culmination of 20+ years of professional brewing experience.

We never focus on pleasing just one style since we love just about all of them and while not every beer we brew will be the perfect student in its category it will be one that will get the craft beer loving palate craving more with each sip.","website":"http:\/\/chainreactionbrewingco.com","established":"2014","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/57GOSM\/upload_valLsz-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-06-23 11:26:33","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:54:59"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"cDW9jR","name":"Main Brewery","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","latitude":39.737567,"longitude":-104.9847179,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","breweryId":"0rQw0S","brewery":{"id":"0rQw0S","name":"Heavenly Daze Brewery and Grill","nameShortDisplay":"Heavenly Daze Brewery and Grill","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:57","updateDate":"2015-12-22 14:47:54"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"mJEOcA","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"PO Box 202896","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","phone":"(303) 720-7550","website":"http:\/\/www.303brewing.com\/","latitude":39.7392358,"longitude":-104.990251,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"Y","openToPublic":"N","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 11:13:42","updateDate":"2016-07-22 20:13:28","breweryId":"9MrbND","brewery":{"id":"9MrbND","name":"303 Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"303","website":"http:\/\/www.303brewing.com\/","mailingListUrl":"http:\/\/www.303brewing.com\/mailing_list.html","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9MrbND\/upload_OjcPix-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9MrbND\/upload_OjcPix-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9MrbND\/upload_OjcPix-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9MrbND\/upload_OjcPix-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/9MrbND\/upload_OjcPix-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-10-23 11:12:41","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:38:15"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ncZcfJ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"2920 Larimer Street","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80205","phone":"303-997-8288","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nWed:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nThu:  3:00pm - 11:00pm\r\nFri:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSat:  12:00pm - 12:00am\r\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:00pm","latitude":39.7614952,"longitude":-104.981064,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-21 04:16:20","updateDate":"2016-02-02 18:02:32","breweryId":"wrKiII","brewery":{"id":"wrKiII","name":"Ratio Beerworks","nameShortDisplay":"Ratio Beerworks","description":"When it comes to beer, consistency is king. That\u2019s why we have anchored our lineup with four meticulously crafted flagship brews.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the staples, we set the brewers loose on seasonal and artisanal options on a rotating basis. Our barrel aging and firkin programs will let us test and refine our more ambitious offerings.\r\n\r\nWe learned how to drink on tour. We learned how to brew in Germany.\r\n\r\nIn many ways, Ratio started in the punk scene back in the late 90\u2019s. We cut our teeth by touring, playing out, creating zines, and working at labels. That DIY mindset prepared us for the challenges of creating and sharing our passions on our own terms. Over the years that energy has been channeled into brewing, learning the craft in Germany and honing our skills at some of the most respected breweries in Colorado. After moving on to successful careers in brewing, marketing, and finance; we have teamed up again for our most ambitious project yet - Ratio Beerworks.\r\n\r\nWith a state of the art 20 barrel system, we will have more than enough beer to go around. And the tap room will be as eclectic as the community that it\u2019s built to support. The scene at Ratio is all about beer, but our art and music programs will ensure all of the senses are stimulated.","website":"http:\/\/ratiobeerworks.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-02-21 04:16:19","updateDate":"2015-12-22 16:05:11"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"3l3jZZ","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1330 Zuni St","extendedAddress":"Unit M","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80204","phone":"720-985-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.strangebrewingco.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Mon - Thu: 3:00 pm - 8:00 pm\r\nFri - Sat: 12:00 pm - 9:00 pm\r\nSun:  1:00 pm - 6:00 pm","latitude":39.7372042,"longitude":-105.0151869,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2010","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:09","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","breweryId":"9NLO7v","brewery":{"id":"9NLO7v","name":"Strange Craft Beer Company","nameShortDisplay":"Strange Craft","description":"Strange Brewing Company, opened in May of 2010, was Denver's first successful nanobrewery, brewing on a one-barrel homebrew setup.

Our desire to participate in every step of the grain to glass process led us to open Our Mutual Friend.\r\n\r\nAt OMF, our goal is to use local sources to brew local ales. This is why we malt and roast as much of the grain we use in our beer as we can. As a small maltstery, we have more influence over the quality and freshness of the beers we pour in our taproom, and more opportunities to source our ingredients locally. 100 percent of our barley is grown right here in Colorado. And as much as possible, we source our hops and specialty ingredients from farms in our state. \r\n\r\nPart of what we love about beer is its power to bring people together (hence our name!). We\u2019re excited to be a gathering place in the Five Points neighborhood where locals and visitors alike can meet in camaraderie alongside a quality pint of ale. We believe in the power of neighborly acts and the spirit of neighbors taking care of one another within the local community. We at OMF support and strive for the Denver community to know each other better and enjoy a good pint in the same process. \r\n\r\nWe are excited to see our city developing a local, world-class brewery community, and look forward to building relationships with our friends and neighbors, and collaborating with other breweries to cherish our Denver home and protect our collective local influence.","website":"http:\/\/www.omfmb.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ij1ASf\/upload_XHdQdj-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ij1ASf\/upload_XHdQdj-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ij1ASf\/upload_XHdQdj-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ij1ASf\/upload_XHdQdj-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/Ij1ASf\/upload_XHdQdj-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-12-01 13:15:12","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:39:04"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"eTXOhc","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1477 Monroe St","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80206","phone":"1-303-927-7365","website":"http:\/\/cerebralbrewing.com\/","hoursOfOperation":"Tue:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nWed:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nThu:  4:00pm - 10:00pm\nFri:  4:00pm - 11:00pm\nSat:  12:00pm - 11:00pm\nSun:  12:00pm - 10:00pm\n\n","latitude":39.7397521,"longitude":-104.9450991,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"nano","locationTypeDisplay":"Nano Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"2015","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-11-22 22:45:52","updateDate":"2016-04-10 22:13:39","breweryId":"hvkvU8","brewery":{"id":"hvkvU8","name":"Cerebral Brewing","nameShortDisplay":"Cerebral","description":"Cerebral Brewing is a neighborhood brewery in the Bluebird District of Denver, Colorado.

We believe this creates a beer that is unrivaled in complexity. Our beers are intended to have a sense of place, terroir, no matter how hard one tried our beer could not be replicated outside of our brewery. In fact, our microbe cultures are purposefully allowed to evolve from batch to batch, creating variations and interesting twists from different releases of the same beer. \r\n\r\nWe are meticulous about designing recipes and processes that will allow nature to take over and create beers unrivaled in their beauty and complexity. Through experimentation and research we are continuously developing new and different techniques for use with wild and spontaneous fermentation.\r\n\r\nWe are not and do not have any intention of being a lambic brewery. We use science and experimentation to find which processes and ingredients we want to use that parallel traditional lambic producers, however - other the the use of a coolship - we maintain no strict adherence to tradition for tradition's sake. Spontaneous fermentation is merely a starting point and core of our process, from there James's research and development extends much beyond the scope of the great Belgian brewers and blenders. \r\n\r\nOur wort is predominantly produced on FFBC's 4bbl brewhouse, and our coolship beers are inoculated on the roof. As of January 2016 our barrel and aging program is housed at Former Future, but we are currently planning to move all Black Project barrels to a second facility in order to allow for growth of both Black Project and Former Future.","website":"http:\/\/www.blackprojectbeer.com","established":"2016","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/FIhV0N\/upload_KJdoo8-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2016-10-25 18:19:49","updateDate":"2016-10-25 18:19:51"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"ojl567","name":"Main Brewpub","streetAddress":"1700 Vine St","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80206","phone":"303-388-2337","website":"http:\/\/www.mountainsunpub.com\/","latitude":39.743508,"longitude":-104.961909,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"brewpub","locationTypeDisplay":"Brewpub","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:12","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","breweryId":"GskozI","brewery":{"id":"GskozI","name":"Vine Street Pub & Brewery","nameShortDisplay":"Vine Street Pub","website":"http:\/\/www.mountainsunpub.com\/","isOrganic":"N","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:12","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:23:23"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"XZa7tI","name":"Mockery Brewing Co.","streetAddress":"3501 Delgany Street","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80126","phone":"303.808.4011","website":"http:\/\/mockerybrewing.blogspot.com\/","latitude":39.7712142,"longitude":-104.9797391,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-04-04 09:34:34","updateDate":"2014-11-20 13:44:14","breweryId":"J841fi","brewery":{"id":"J841fi","name":"Mockery Brewing Co.","nameShortDisplay":"Mockery","description":"Mockery Brewing is a craft brewery that focuses on bold flavors while maintaining the utmost respect for balance and quality.

Drink options include the coffee-alcohol Java Porter, or the XXX Pale Ale, a hoppy brew with flavor and bite.\"","website":"http:\/\/www.mountainsunpub.com\/","established":"1993","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fQwjb1\/upload_z8NIac-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fQwjb1\/upload_z8NIac-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fQwjb1\/upload_z8NIac-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fQwjb1\/upload_z8NIac-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/fQwjb1\/upload_z8NIac-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2016-01-04 21:07:10"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"VGRuro","name":"Yak & Yeti Restaurant and Event Center","streetAddress":"9755 E Hampden Ave","locality":"Denver","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80231","phone":"(303) 751-9443","latitude":39.6536067,"longitude":-104.8744116,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"restaurant","locationTypeDisplay":"Restaurant\/Ale House","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-09 16:32:11","updateDate":"2016-06-23 18:37:15","breweryId":"De8Q5F","brewery":{"id":"De8Q5F","name":"Yak & Yeti Brewpub","nameShortDisplay":"Yak & Yeti Brewpub","description":"The Yak and Yeti Brewpub is located in Olde Town Arvada and resides in an 1864 haunted Victorian brick mansion.
