We've been making beer for many years now and wanted to share our love of beer with as many people as we could. With that in mind, we founded Great Storm Brewing in 2010, and opened our doors and our taps to the public in March 2012.\r\n\r\nOur name? Well, for us, there's a lot of anticipation in tasting a new beer. The way the foam settles in a glass of dark stout, or the raining effect you can see in a pint of IPA served on nitro... they remind us sometimes of the expectant feeling we get watching powerful storms roll in over the mountains in our home town of Colorado Springs. Yes, we tend to wax poetic over a pint glass. I told you we love beer. But anyway, that was part of the inspiration. The other part was our beloved half Husky, half Aussie brewdog, Storm. He's a little... wild. Like our beers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope you'll find the same passion for drinking our beers as we do for making them. Come in and see us, we'll be pleased to pour you a pint.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe wax a little poetic about it.","website":"http:\/\/www.greatstormbrewing.com\/","established":"2012","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ersDcu\/upload_8F4X0S-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ersDcu\/upload_8F4X0S-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ersDcu\/upload_8F4X0S-large.png","squareMedium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ersDcu\/upload_8F4X0S-squareMedium.png","squareLarge":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/ersDcu\/upload_8F4X0S-squareLarge.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-02-21 15:15:20","updateDate":"2015-12-22 15:51:32"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"}},{"id":"40KTFD","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"1647 South Tejon Street","locality":"Colorado Springs","region":"Colorado","postalCode":"80906","phone":"719-633-2555","website":"http:\/\/www.bristolbrewing.com\/","latitude":38.8097336,"longitude":-104.8261746,"isPrimary":"N","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","yearOpened":"1994","yearClosed":"2013","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:48","updateDate":"2014-07-23 19:11:34","breweryId":"pkjt6v","brewery":{"id":"pkjt6v","name":"Bristol Brewing Company","nameShortDisplay":"Bristol","description":"In June of 1994, Bristol Brewing Company settled comfortably in the lap of Pikes Peak and began hand-brewing flavorful, one-of-a-kind ales for the people of Colorado.

All addresses and street plans originate from the intersection of Pikes Peak and Cascade. The building is named after Cheyenne Mountain and Chief Two Moons of the Cheyenne Indian Tribe (whose stone visage looks over the front entrance).about image About PCBC\r\n\r\nOur second floor boasts the most elegant billiard hall in Colorado Springs.
